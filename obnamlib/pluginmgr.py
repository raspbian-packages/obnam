'''A generic plugin manager.

The plugin manager finds files with plugins and loads them. It looks
for plugins in a number of locations specified by the caller. To add
a plugin to be loaded, it is enough to put it in one of the locations,
and name it *_plugin.py. (The naming convention is to allow having
other modules as well, such as unit tests, in the same locations.)

import imp
import inspect
import os


class Plugin(object):

    '''Base class for plugins.
    
    A plugin MUST NOT have any side effects when it is instantiated.
    This is necessary so that it can be safely loaded by unit tests,
    and so that a user interface can allow the user to disable it,
    even if it is installed, with no ill effects. Any side effects
    that would normally happen should occur in the enable() method,
    and be undone by the disable() method. These methods must be
    callable any number of times.
    
    The subclass MAY define the following attributes:
    
    * name
    * description
    * version
    * required_application_version
    
    name is the user-visible identifier for the plugin. It defaults
    to the plugin's classname.
    
    description is the user-visible description of the plugin. It may
    be arbitrarily long, and can use pango markup language. Defaults
    to the empty string.
    
    version is the plugin version. Defaults to '0.0.0'. It MUST be a
    sequence of integers separated by periods. If several plugins with
    the same name are found, the newest version is used. Versions are
    compared integer by integer, starting with the first one, and a 
    missing integer treated as a zero. If two plugins have the same 
    version, either might be used.
    
    required_application_version gives the version of the minimal 
    application version the plugin is written for. The first integer
    must match exactly: if the application is version 2.3.4, the
    plugin's required_application_version must be at least 2 and
    at most 2.3.4 to be loaded. Defaults to 0.

        an extended base class that does some application specific
        magic when plugins are enabled or disabled.

    This class finds and loads plugins, and keeps a list of them that
    can be accessed in various ways.
    
    The locations are set via the locations attribute, which is a list.
    
    When a plugin is loaded, an instance of its class is created. This
    instance is initialized using normal and keyword arguments specified
    in the plugin manager attributes plugin_arguments and 
    plugin_keyword_arguments.
    
    The version of the application using the plugin manager is set via

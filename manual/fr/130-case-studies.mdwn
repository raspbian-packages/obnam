Case studies
============

This chapter goes through, in some detail, some typical use cases for
backups. For case, it discusses the data being backed up, and explains
choices of backup strategy, storage, etc. Some case studies:

* Single laptop user, typical data of documents, photos, music,
  backing up to a USB hard drive.
* A VPS or similar server, with web pages, e-mail, and maybe other
  data, backed up to another server.
* A small company with a number of laptops and desktops, a local file
  server, a rented co-lo server, backing up to a rented server in a
  co-lo and to a rotated set of large USB drives.
* Restoring from a complete disaster, where all local computers and
  storage media are destroyed, but there is an off-site backup that
  is intact.

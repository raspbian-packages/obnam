The backup repository internals
===============================

This chapter describes what the Obnam backup repository looks like.
Unless you're interested in that, you can skip that entirely.

For now, look at the Obnam website at <http://obnam.org/development/>.


Repository file permissions
---------------------------

Obnam sets the permissions of all files it creates in the repository
such that only the owner of the files can read or write them.
(Technically, 0600 for files, 0700 for directories.)

This is to prevent backups from leaking because someone else has read
access to the repository. There is no setting in Obnam to control
this.

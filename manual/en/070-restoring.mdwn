Restoring from backups
======================

The worst has happened! Your cat got confused between its litter box
and your hard drive! Your goat deleted your most important document
ever! Woe be you!

Let's stay calm. This is why you have backups. There's no need for
exclamation marks. Take a deep breath, have a cup of tea, and all will
be well.

There's two different approaches for restoring data with Obnam. One
relies on a FUSE filesystem, which is a very nice piece of technology
that allows Obnam to let you view your backups as just another
directory. It is the preferred way, but it is not always available, so
Obnam also provides a more primitive, less easy to use method.

Oh no! It's all FUSEd together
------------------------------

The `obnam mount` command lets you look at your backups as if they
were just another directory. This requires that you have FUSE setup.
See the installation chapter for details on that. Most modern Linux
desktops have this out of the box.

    mkdir ~/backups
    obnam mount --to ~/backups

Run the above command, and then look at the `~/backups` directory.
You'll see something like this:

    $ ls -l ~/backups
    total 12
    drwxr-xr-x 24 root root 4096 Feb 11 21:41 2
    drwxr-xr-x 24 root root 4096 Feb 11 21:41 5
    lrwxr-xr-x 24 root root 4096 Feb 11 21:41 latest -> 5
    $ 

Each directory in `~/backups` is a backup generation, named after the
generation identifier Obnam invents. The `latest` symbolic link points
at the latest generation.

After this, you can restore a single file very easily:

    cp ~/backups/latest/home/tomjon/Documents/iloveyou.txt ~/restored.txt

You can copy any files you want from the `~/backups` directory, from
any generation, or all of them if you want to. You can look at files
directly, before copying them out, too.

    less ~/backups/2/home/tomjon/Documents/iloveyou.txt
    
This is an easy way to make sure you find the right version instead of
just the latest one.

You can't delete anything in `~/backups`. That directory is read-only,
and you can't accidentally, or on purpose, delete or modify anything
there. This is intentional: the `obnam mount` command is meant to be a
safe way for you to look at your backups, not something you need to be
careful about.

Once you're done looking at your backups, you can un-mount the
repository:

    fusermount -u ~/backups

In addition to doing these things from the command line, you can, of
course, use your favourite file manager (graphical or textual) to look
at your backed up files. The mounting and un-mounting (depending on
your desktop setup) may need to be done on the command line.

Restoring without FUSE
----------------------

When `obnam mount` isn't available, you can do restores directly with
just Obnam. Use `obnam generations` and `obnam ls` to find the right
generation to restore, and then run a command like this:

    obnam restore --to /tmp/tomjon-restored /home/tomjon/Documents
    
This would restore just the indicated directory. If you don't tell
Obnam what to restore, it'll restore everything in the latest
generation. You can choose a different generation with `--generation`:

    obnam restore --to /tmp/tomjon-restored --generation 2

Note that you can't restore to a directory that already exists. This
is to prevent you from accidentally overwriting your live data with
restored files. If you do want replace your live data with restored
files, you should restore to a temporary location first, and then move
the files to where you want them to be.

The file or directory you want to restore must be specified using an
absolute path, i.e., starting from / and not relative to the current
directory.

An actual example of a restoration
----------------------------------

I had a corrupted gnus file, and this is how I restored it from backup. 

    obnam --config=/home/foobar/cron/conf/obnam.conf generations>~/cron/upload/obgen.txt

This copies all generations for the main obnam backup to obgen.txt, and this
is part of that file. 

    1207586	2014-08-25 08:00:43 .. 2014-08-25 08:08:24 (385163 files, 175029819657 bytes) 
    1208367	2014-08-25 12:00:42 .. 2014-08-25 12:08:31 (385965 files, 175057598863 bytes) 
    1209313	2014-08-25 16:00:12 .. 2014-08-25 16:07:33 (386537 files, 175076976590 bytes) 
    1210254	2014-08-25 20:00:15 .. 2014-08-25 20:09:41 (386896 files, 175086483254 bytes) 
 
And I decided to restore from generation 1208367.

This is the actual restore command.

    obnam --config=/home/foobar/cron/conf/obnam.conf --generation=1208367 restore ~/News/rss/nnrss.el --to=/home/foobar/cron/upload/

This restores 'nnrss.el' to ~/cron/upload/ from where I was able to copy it
back to its proper place in ~/News/rss/ 

Obviously you replace your user-name for foobar. 

Practice makes prestores painless
---------------------------------

You should practice doing restores. This makes you trust your backups
more, and lets you be calmer if disaster were to strike. (In fancier
terms, you should test your disaster recovery plan.)

Do a trial restore of a few files, or all files, until you're sure you
know how to do that. Then do it again, from time to time, to be sure
your backups still work. It's much less frightening to do a real
restore, when data has actually gone missing, if you've done it
before.

In extreme cases, particularly if you're an Obnam developer, you
perhaps format your hard drive and then do complete restore, just so
you know you can. If you're not an Obnam developer, this is perhaps a
bit extreme: at least use a separate hard drive instead of your normal
one.

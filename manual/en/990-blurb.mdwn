Supporting Obnam development
============================

Obnam is free software: you get full access to the source code, you
can modify the software as you wish, and you can distribute copies of
the software in its original or modified form. It is also free of
charge.

One of the goals of Obnam is to make sure everyone has access to
nice backup software, and are not beholden to anyone else for that
software. You can use Obnam, and store your backups anywhere that
suits you, and the Obnam developers have no say in that.

However, Obnam development requires some resources. Obnam is primarily
developed by Lars Wirzenius, its original author (hi!), in his free
time. If you would like to help support Obnam development, here's a
list of things you could do:

* Send fixes and improvements, either to code or documentation.
* Donate something to the author. See
  <http://liw.fi/obnam/donate/> for suggestions.
* Hire the author to do some Obnam development. Contact him privately
  by e-mail (liw@liw.fi).

Note that any of these are optional. If you like Obnam, and are happy
just using it, that's completely OK.

Multiple backup generations
===========================

This chapter contains tests for Obnam's handling of multiple
generations: making incremental backups, forgetting generations, and
so on. We assume that backing up any individual directory tree works
fine, regardless of whether it is for the initial generation or an
incremental one. In the previous chapter for basic backups, we've
already dealt with those. This chapter focuses on generation handling
only.

Incremental backup generations (`obnam backup`)
------------------------------

First of all, most importantly, we must be able to make more than one
backup generation, and restore them. The live data in each generation
is different, but there are unchanged parts as well. For simplicity,
we'll assume that if we can do two generations, we can do any number.
It's possible that the 12765th generation might break, but that's
unlikely, and it's even less likely we'll guess it. (If it turns out
to actually happen, we'll add a regression test when we find the
problem.)

    SCENARIO backup two generations
    GIVEN 1MB of new data in directory L
    AND a manifest of L in G1
    WHEN user U backs up directory L to repository R
    GIVEN 2MB of new data in directory L
    AND a manifest of L in G2
    WHEN user U backs up directory L to repository R
    AND user U restores generation 1 to R1 from repository R
    AND user U restores generation 2 to R2 from repository R
    THEN L, restored to R1, matches manifest G1
    AND L, restored to R2, matches manifest G2

Listing generations (`obnam generations`, `obnam genids`)
-------------------

When we make some number of generations, the Obnam generation listing
commands should show that number of generations.

    SCENARIO list generations
    GIVEN 1MB of new data in directory L
    WHEN user U backs up directory L to repository R
    AND user U backs up directory L to repository R
    AND user U backs up directory L to repository R
    THEN user U sees 3 generations in repository R
    AND user U sees 3 generation ids in repository R

Listing contents of a generation (`obnam ls`)
--------------------------------

We'll assume the `obnam ls` command shows any generation.
However, there's a couple of ways of using it: either listing
everything, or only a specific directory to list.

    SCENARIO list generation content
    GIVEN 1MB of new data in directory D
    WHEN user U backs up directory D to repository R
    AND user U lists latest generation in repository R into all.txt
    THEN all.txt matches /.*/D/.
    WHEN user U lists D in latest generation in repository R into some.txt
    THEN all lines in some.txt match (/D|Generation)

The first line of the generation listing contains the word
"Generation". Every other line should contain the directory we
requested as part of the pathname.

There was a bug in Obnam 1.5 (and possibly other versions) that
listing contents of a directory that ends in a slash (but isn't the
root directory) fails. The following is a test for that bug by
requesting `D/` to be listed, and verifying that we get at least one
line for that.

    WHEN user U lists D/ in latest generation in repository R into bug.txt
    THEN bug.txt matches /D

Comparing generations (`obnam diff`)
------------------------------------

Once we've backed up two generations, we need to be able to see the
difference. First of all, the diff should be empty when the
generations are identical:

    SCENARIO diff identical generations
    GIVEN 1K of new data in directory L
    WHEN user U backs up directory L to repository R
    AND user U backs up directory L to repository R
    AND user U diffs generations 1 and 2 in repository R into D
    THEN file D is empty

`obnam diff` can be used with just one generation, and that compares
it with the generation preceding the given one.

    WHEN user U diffs latest generation in repository R into D
    THEN file D is empty
    
If we make a change to the data, that should be reflected in the diff.
We'll assume the diff works, we'll just check whether it's empty.

    SCENARIO diff modified generations
    GIVEN 1K of new data in directory L
    WHEN user U backs up directory L to repository R
    GIVEN 1K of new data in directory L
    WHEN user U backs up directory L to repository R
    AND user U diffs generations 1 and 2 in repository R into D
    THEN file D is not empty

`obnam forget` does nothing by default
----------------------

`obnam forget` is the command to remove backup generations from the
repository. It can be used to remove specific generations, or to
remove generations according to a schedule. If neither is specified,
it should do nothing.

    SCENARIO forget does nothing by default
    GIVEN 1K of new data in directory L
    AND a manifest of L in M

    WHEN user U backs up directory L to repository R
    AND user U runs obnam forget without generations or keep policy on repository R
    THEN user U sees 1 generation in repository R

    WHEN user U restores their latest generation in repository R into X
    THEN L, restored to X, matches manifest M

Forgetting a specific generation (`obnam forget`)
--------------------------------

We need to be able to remove any generation. As a corner case, we
should be able to remove the only generation. We'll test by making two
generations, then removing both, and after removing the first one,
checking that the remaining one is the one we want.

    SCENARIO remove specific generations
    GIVEN 1kB of new data in directory L
    AND a manifest of L in M1
    WHEN user U backs up directory L to repository R
    GIVEN 1kB of new data in directory L
    AND a manifest of L in M2
    WHEN user U backs up directory L to repository R
    AND user U forgets the oldest generation in repository R
    THEN user U sees 1 generation in repository R
    WHEN user U restores their latest generation in repository R into X
    THEN L, restored to X, matches manifest M2
    WHEN user U forgets the oldest generation in repository R
    THEN user U sees 0 generations in repository R

Forgetting generations according to a schedule (`obnam forget --keep`)
-------------------------------------------------------------

The normal way of forgetting generations is with the `obnam forget
--keep` option.

    SCENARIO remove generations according to schedule
    GIVEN 1kB of new data in directory L
    WHEN user U backs up directory L to repository R
    GIVEN 1kB of new data in directory L
    AND a manifest of L in M
    WHEN user U backs up directory L to repository R
    AND user U forgets according to schedule 1y in repository R
    THEN user U sees 1 generation in repository R
    WHEN user U restores their latest generation in repository R into X
    THEN L, restored to X, matches manifest M

There has been reports that the "keep N hourly backups" type of
`--keep` policy doesn't work. Test this by creating several
generations, pretending the time is something specific, and then check
that the right ones get kept. For each calendar hour, we make two
generations, and we create them for every other calendar hour, for
four such hours (covering a total of eight hours). We then keep two
hourly backups. This should result in the later of each backup during
a calendar hour to be kept, for the last two calendar hours.

    SCENARIO keep N hourly generations

The first generation of the first hour.

    GIVEN user U sets configuration pretend-time to 2014-03-19 01:00:00
    AND 1kB of new data in directory L
    WHEN user U backs up directory L to repository R

The second generation of the first hour.

    GIVEN user U sets configuration pretend-time to 2014-03-19 01:30:00
    AND 1kB of new data in directory L
    WHEN user U backs up directory L to repository R

The first generation of the second hour.

    GIVEN user U sets configuration pretend-time to 2014-03-19 02:00:00
    AND 1kB of new data in directory L
    WHEN user U backs up directory L to repository R

The second generation of the second hour.

    GIVEN user U sets configuration pretend-time to 2014-03-19 02:30:00
    AND 1kB of new data in directory L
    WHEN user U backs up directory L to repository R

The first generation of the third hour.

    GIVEN user U sets configuration pretend-time to 2014-03-19 03:00:00
    AND 1kB of new data in directory L
    WHEN user U backs up directory L to repository R

The second generation of the third hour.

    GIVEN user U sets configuration pretend-time to 2014-03-19 03:30:00
    AND 1kB of new data in directory L
    WHEN user U backs up directory L to repository R

The first generation of the fourth hour.

    GIVEN user U sets configuration pretend-time to 2014-03-19 04:00:00
    AND 1kB of new data in directory L
    WHEN user U backs up directory L to repository R

The second generation of the fourth hour.

    GIVEN user U sets configuration pretend-time to 2014-03-19 04:30:00
    AND 1kB of new data in directory L
    WHEN user U backs up directory L to repository R

Now run the forget and verify.

    WHEN user U forgets according to schedule 2h in repository R
    THEN user U sees 2 generations in repository R
    AND user U has 1st generation timestamp 2014-03-19 03:30:00 in repository R
    AND user U has 2nd generation timestamp 2014-03-19 04:30:00 in repository R

Dnn't really forget anything if pretending
------------------------------------------

The `--pretend` option prevents `obnam forget` from actually removing
anything, but lets the user see what would be removed.

    SCENARIO forget doesn't really, when pretending
    GIVEN 1kB of new data in directory L
    WHEN user U backs up directory L to repository R
    GIVEN 1kB of new data in directory L
    AND a manifest of L in M
    WHEN user U backs up directory L to repository R
    AND user U pretends to forget according to schedule 1y in repository R
    THEN user U sees 2 generations in repository R
    WHEN user U restores their latest generation in repository R into X
    THEN L, restored to X, matches manifest M
